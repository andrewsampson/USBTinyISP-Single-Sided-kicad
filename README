This project is a re-implementation of the PCB for ladyada's USBtinyISP, a 
flash programmer for AVR microcontrollers.  The board has been redesigned 
using kicad (instead of Eagle) and is single-sided (instead of two-sided).  
The board layout is based on lowvoltage's design, with some minor changes.  

The primary goal of this project was to produce USBtinyISP boards with my CNC 
machine.  This necessitated a single-sided design with wide traces.  

Additionally, the board is now compatible with dangerousprototypes' "Sick of 
Beige" standard, which specifies the board size and mounting hole positions.  
The lowvoltage design was already really close to the 60mm x 37mm standard, so 
it didn't take much tweaking to make everything fit.
